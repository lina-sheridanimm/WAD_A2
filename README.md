Create a website that contains a homepage, articles, an about page and a contact page.

All pages must contain a header with:
- a logo
- Navigation with a list of links. The links are: "Home", "About", "Contact".

Create a footer with:
- A footer about about cookie usage and link to "accept cookies". This link's href should point to "#" for the time being. (We do not need to implement cookie usage at this time)

Home page must contain:

A welcome title and paragraph

A "featured" article. 

3 categories of articles: "Industry","Technical","Career"
Each of these categories contains 2 articles.
Each article component (including the featured article) contains:
- An image
- An author
- A title
- preview text
- a link to the full article page on your site.

The homepage must contain a table that describes the following data:
- The number of site visitors each month for the last 6 months. Use fake data for now.

A video of your choice (youtube embeds ok!)

All article pages must be stored in a sub folder named "articles".

Each article page must contain:
- An image
- An author
- A title
- Long text content
- a link to an external source of the article.
- a "Go back" link to the homepage

The "About" page should contain a short paragraph about the site.

The "Contact" page should contain a form with the following elements:
- textfield for Name (required)
- texfield for email (required and validated as email)
- checkboxes for "Category interests" (User can select multiple from "Industry","Technical" or "Career")
- a select box for "Your role" (User can select only one from "Writer","Contributor" or "Administrator")
- A submit button
The form should submit to a "process-contact.php" using the POST method. The code for this page is not necessary for this assignment

This is NOT a signup or registration form. It is a contact form.

Add a favicon and appropriate metadata to your pages.
