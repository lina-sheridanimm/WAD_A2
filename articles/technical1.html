        virtual reality

        “Our industry’s ability to thrill global audiences is fueled by the collective genius of our creative teams and their inspired 
        use of technology,” said society president Jim Chabin. “This year’s honorees reflect a stunning new level of technical 
        achievement we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago.”
