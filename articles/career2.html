        <h3>How to Pilot a Fighter Jet Like Maverick</h3>

        Naval Capt. Brian “Ferg” Ferguson’s reaction to hearing that the actors in Paramount’s Top Gun: Maverick would perform practical aerial stunts 
        with Navy planes was hardly enthusiastic. “There was certainly a way to do this quicker, cheaper, faster,” says the film’s naval aviation technical 
        adviser, who nonetheless came around once he saw daily footage. “I went, ‘Oh, now I get it. This wouldn’t have worked in a simulator.’ 
        ” Yet, to get the actors to look not just like experienced fighter pilots but be qualified enough to sit in the passenger seat of a Hornet was a 
        long road. “Tom Cruise had us put this in-depth curriculum together,” says aerial coordinator Kevin LaRosa. “We basically made pilots.” For three 
        months, the cast (Cruise is an experienced pilot) went through rigorous training, starting with aviation physiology survival school — i.e., being 
        dragged through a pool while wearing a parachute. “If something were to happen in the plane and you have to eject, you’ve had experience doing that 
        with these training devices,” says Ferguson. Once the actors were qualified to handle an emergency, LaRosa taught them how to fly a Cessna 172, then 
        built their G tolerance and spatial orientation. “If it looks like they’re flying, it’s because they might as well be,” he says. The rest is meticulous 
        simulation, with details Ferguson still receives praise for from peers who have seen the movie. “You don’t want the actors touching the control stick 
        when you’re down at 100 feet doing 600 miles an hour. It could be catastrophic. We’d show them how to hold their hands, and the Navy pilots in the 
        front of the F-18s would call out the turns so the actors could make their motions,” he says. “Their timing is perfect.”

        <h3>How to Rampage Like a Viking</h3>

        Hired to bring authenticity to the movement of Viking-age warriors for Focus Features’ The Northman, British choreographer and performance artist 
        Marie-Gabrielle Rotie was at a bit of a loss. “We’re dealing with something dating back to even earlier than the 10th century, so we don’t have any 
        authentic vestige of Viking dance. There is no precedent for it,” she says. The solution: “I had to invent something.” The expert on butoh, a form of 
        Japanese theater in which body contortions express anguish and rapture, worked to create a raw yet purposeful expression of physicality that would 
        combine the spiritual, carnal, animal and visceral to create a transition of men turning into beasts. “The berserkers are huge men who wouldn’t be 
        dainty or move very gracefully. I had to work with that,” she says. She applied the same perspective to the film’s sword fighting. “Originally, I was 
        doing lovely spirals and jabs, but even the sword fighting couldn’t be standard,” says Rotie. “In the end, we had to come into something where the 
        sword is used in quite a brutal way. We arrived at a oneness between the body and the weapon.” Director Robert Eggers also wanted to incorporate the 
        biting of shields. “The berserkers were known for chewing on their shields to create group bonding,” explains Rotie. “Whether it’s the shield, the sword 
        or any prop, I see that as sending energy through the body into the instrument.” For the Norse rituals, Rotie provided the actors with a series of moves 
        that were then fused together, making the cast authors of the material as much as the choreographer herself. “We didn’t coach them to death,” she says. 
        “The important thing was to keep that rawness.”

        <h3>How to Cave Dive Like a Professional</h3>

        Had cave diver Richard Stanton not signed on to Amazon’s Thirteen Lives as a technical adviser, there was no one else to call. “Our techniques are 
        unique and specific to us,” he says. “Cave diving is a niche activity anyway, but our style is even more unique, and that’s why we were successful.” 
        In 2018, Stanton and fellow cave diver John Volanthen (played by Colin Farrell) took the lead in rescuing a soccer team of 12 and their coach from a 
        flooded cave in Thailand — an incredible feat that Viggo Mortensen, when cast as Stanton in the Ron Howard film, wanted to fully immerse himself in. 
        There was just one problem. “There was a pandemic, so there were lots of Zoom calls,” says Stanton, who also supplied Mortensen with an early copy of 
        Aquanaut: A Life Beneath the Surface for a detailed account of the harrowing experience. Unable to take the actor diving himself, Stanton connected 
        Mortensen with friends of his in northern Spain. “They took him to a cave just to get a feel for it. He didn’t ask permission from production in case 
        they would say no,” says Stanton with a chuckle. On set in Australia, inside an industrial warehouse where three caves were created for filming purposes, 
        Stanton was made camera-ready each day in case he needed to portray himself. He found himself better utilized above water. “The job of an A-list actor 
        is to take directions, and I was just giving them directions: This is what I look like and this is how I act underwater,” he says. From the scuffed-up 
        suits to the tension created by Howard, Stanton is pleased with the portrayal. “They all grasped it really, really well,” he says. “Later they said that 
        some of it was quite stressful. But it didn’t show on their faces.”

        <h3>How to Think Like a Michelin-Starred Chef</h3>

        When renowned chef Dominique Crenn was approached to consult on the Searchlight black comedy The Menu, the bulk of the gig was surprisingly not teaching 
        Ralph Fiennes how to cook. “You can teach anyone to cut a potato, but you can’t teach everyone how to present themselves with authenticity,” says Crenn, 
        whose job it was to infuse Fiennes with the mentality of a three-star Michelin chef. “The chef is a director, he’s a conductor, he is in charge of his 
        ship. He leads a team, and he is also very creative, so there’s this other part of him that is a very sensitive artist. It was about confidence.” Crenn 
        spent hours — and many, many meals — in conversation with Fiennes to help him understand the psychology of a kitchen and the nature of her work. “A chef 
        at that level is not really behind the line anymore. We are the creator, writing the menus, working with the sous chef and the chef. You have a brigade to 
        literally put to life your creation,” she says. “Ralph’s job was to make sure he was paying attention to everybody. You walk into the kitchen and people 
        think that you’re looking straight, but your eyes are everywhere. You know everything that’s going on.” Crenn praises not just Fiennes but his onscreen 
        kitchen staff for nailing the extreme precision that sets this level of dining experience apart. “The importance of this movie was the integrity of every 
        movement,” she says. “Every movement was exactly as we do it in the restaurant: the way the cooks stand on the line; the way they plate the food; how a 
        server will hold the water or the wine; how they serve the person. I always say that it’s a choreography: We all have to come together. Detail is everything.”
